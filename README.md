Hi there,

This is InstincT, and I am a young individual with a passion for science, technology, and artificial intelligence. I am proud to say that I achieved first place in a state-level science exhibition during my 11th grade with my project, an automatic Rubik's cube solver using artificial intelligence. In my free time, I enjoy working on my own website, named instinctcms.com, and practicing my coding skills. I have experience with programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and SQL, as well as frontend coding and basic android and iOS development. I am particularly interested in exploring the possibilities of artificial intelligence and am always looking for ways to learn and grow in this field. I am also excited to share that I have been selected in the first round of Intel interview, which is a great achievement for me. I am dedicated to exploring the possibilities of AI and am always seeking new ways to improve my skills and understanding in this field.
